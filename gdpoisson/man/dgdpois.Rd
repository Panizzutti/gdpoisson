\title{Probability Mass Function of the GD-Poisson Distribution}
\usage{
dgdpois(k, lambda, theta)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{A vector of non-negative integers at which to evaluate the PMF.}

\item{lambda}{A positive parameter representing the mean of the distribution.}

\item{theta}{A positive parameter representing the dispersion of the distribution.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as \code{k}, containing the PMF evaluated at each element of \code{k}.
}
\description{
Computes the probability mass function (PMF) of the GD-Poisson distribution for a vector of integer values. The parameters \code{lambda} and \code{theta} can also be vectors of the same length as \code{k}, or any parameter can be a single value to be applied across all evaluations.
}
\details{
The GD-Poisson distribution allows for greater flexibility in modeling count data with over-dispersion compared to the standard Poisson distribution.

The function is vectorized, meaning that \code{k}, \code{lambda}, and \code{theta} can be vectors. If any of these parameters are single values (length 1), they will be used for all evaluations. All vector inputs must either be of the same length or have a length of 1.
}
\examples{
# Evaluate the PMF at k = 0:10 with lambda = 2 and theta = 1
dgdpois(0:10, lambda = 2, theta = 1)

# Vectorized parameters: different values for theta
dgdpois(0:5, lambda = 2, theta = c(1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5))

# Scalar lambda and theta with vector k
dgdpois(0:5, lambda = 2, theta = 1)
